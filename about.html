                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                <p>
                    Now a days health industries are facing many problems related to devices or machines which
                    will give unaccepted and wrong result due to less calibration of the instruments . 
                    So to avoid those drawbacks and get the desired and correct results we are building a project 
                    which will give the accurate prediction based on information provided by the user and also by 
                    dataset that are available in that machine .
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore the problem is that many people goes to hospitals or clinic to know how is 
                    their health and how much they are improving in those sick days but for this they have to travel
                    to  get to know their answers and sometimes it may happens that doctor wont be available or 
                    he/she may be on leave and many more reasons will be there so to avoid all these confusion 
                    and reasons we are making this project which will help all those person's and all the patients
                    who are in need to know the condition of their health. This project will help  to the various
                    people's ranging from children to teenagers to adults and also the senior citizens .

              <p>
                
                In this paper, we have presented a system which is suitable for real-time diseases 
                prediction and can be used by the users who have communicable
                 or non-communicable disease. 
                 The diagnosis system of the system is able to
                  predict the any disease by using Machine Learning algorithms and the prediction 
                  results are based on the disease dataset instance. 
                  On the other hand, the system is very inexpensive. 
                  

              </p>
              <p>
                To prove the effectiveness of the system we have carried out experiments for diagnosis system .
                We ran experiments with some popular algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree. 
                The experiment was carried out with the holdout test .
                Such a system can decrease the rush at OPDs of hospitals and reduce the workload on medical staff.
                 Such a system can be largely reliable to do the job creating this system we also added a way to store 
                 the data entered by the user in the database which can be used in future to help in creating
                  better version of such system. Our system also has an easy to use interface.
                   It also has various visual representation of data collected and results.
